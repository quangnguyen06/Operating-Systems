From what I've learned about the Windows 10, I know that Cortana, the virtual assistance supports users through Bing. The feature is very useful when we can ask it to do searching by voice.
The iOS is continuously updated and it is used to run mobile devices of Apple and it supports many languages. Which has been one of the many reasons to help Apple mobile devices go about every country in the world.
There is one operating system that I has used, which is called Android and it's used on almost all of mobile devices other than Apple's. Android supports many languages as well and allows users to easily interact with the files of applications.
